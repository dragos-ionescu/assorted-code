# H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

These are Haskell translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems, which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems.

If you want to work on one of these, put your name in the block so we know someone's working on it. Then, change n in your block to the appropriate problem number, and fill in the <Problem description>,<example in Haskell>,<solution in haskell> and <description of implementation> fields. Then be sure to update the status on this page to indicate that we have a solution!
